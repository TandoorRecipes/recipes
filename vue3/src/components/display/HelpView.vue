                        <p class="mt-3">While everyone can access all recipes by default, Books, Shopping Lists and Mealplans are not shared by default. You can share them with other

                        <p class="mt-3">Recipes are the foundation of your Tandoor space. A Recipe has one or more steps that contain ingredients, instructions and other information.
                            Ingredients in turn consist of an amount, a unit and a food, allowing recipes to be scaled, nutrition's to be calculated and shopping to be organized.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Besides manually creating them you can also import them from various different places.

                        <p class="mt-3">Recipes, by default, are visible to all members of your space. Setting them to private means only you can see it. After setting it to private you
                            can manually specify the people who should be able to view the recipe.
                            You can also create a share link for the recipe to share it with everyone that has access to the link.

                        <p class="mt-3">The Recipe importer is one of the most powerful features of Tandoor and allows you to quickly add recipes in multiple different ways.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">The easiest is to import from a URL. If that is not enough you can also import from an Image or PDF file using AI.

                        <p class="mt-3">If you already have an existing Recipe database in another format there is also a good chance Tandoor will have an
                            importer for that program.

                            They are also essential for the calculation of Properties.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Setting a base unit allows you to name your Unit however you want (e.g. grams, g, G, gram) while allowing Tandoor
                            to automatically convert between the units in the same system (weight/volume, e.g. from g to kg or from cup to pint).
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">Additionally you can use custom unit conversion to convert between volume and weight trough the specific density
                            of a food (e.g. 1 cup of flour = 120 g). These conversions are used to calculate the Properties for a Recipe
                            and might allow cosmetic display changes later.

                            Most commonly you would use this to add nutrition facts but the system can also be used to track prices,
                            dietary points or any other kind of property.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">You first need to create the Property Types that you need (e.g. Carbohydrates, Sugar, Price, Points, ..).
                            Setting the FDC ID for a Property Type allows Tandoor to connect your custom Property Type to a property in the FDC database.
                            You can then go to a Food, set its FDC ID and Tandoor can automatically pull the properties you want from the FDC database.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">When adding a Property to the Recipe it will just be statically displayed in the Recipe view.
                            Adding properties to a Foods will allow Tandoor to calculate the properties for all the Ingredients in a Recipe based
                            on the Foods and their respective Units and Amounts.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Food Properties are entered based on a certain amount of food (often 100 g). Unit Conversions allow Tandoor to
                            calculate the property amount if a Food is given in a different unit (e.g. 1kg or 1 cup).
                        </p>
