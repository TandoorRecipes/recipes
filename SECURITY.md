# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since this software is still considered beta/WIP support is always only given for the latest version. There are no backports of security or any other fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a normal public issue if you have any security related concerns. If you feel like the issue should not be discussed in 
public just open a generic issue and we will discuss further communication there (since GitHub does not allow everyone to create a security advisory :/).
