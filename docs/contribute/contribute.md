## Issues and Feature Requests

The most basic but also very important way of contributing is reporting issues and commenting on ideas and feature requests
over at [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vabene1111/recipes/issues).

Without feedback improvement can't happen, so don't hesitate to say what you want to say.

## Documentation

Helping improve the documentation for Tandoor is one of the easiest ways to give back and doesn't even require deep technical knowledge.
You can write guides on how to install and configure Tandoor expanding our repository of non-standard configuations.
Or you can write how-to guides using some of Tandoor's advanced features such as authentication or automation.

See [here](/contribute/documentation) for more information on how to add documentation to Tandoor.

## Contributing Code

For the truly ambitious, you can help write code to fix issues, add additional features, or write your own scripts using
Tandoor's extensive API and share your work with the community.

Before writing any code, please make sure that you review [contribution guidelines](/contribute/guidelines) and
[VSCode](/contribute/vscode) or [PyCharm](/contribute/pycharm) specific configurations.
