The documentation is built from the markdown files in the [docs](https://github.com/vabene1111/recipes/tree/develop/docs)
folder of the GitHub repository.

In order to contribute to the documentation, there are a couple of methods that you can use.

## Directly on GitHub

You can fork the develop repository and edit the markdown files directly on the GitHub website.

## With an IDE

You can fork the develop repository and edit the markdown files from your favorite IDE such as VSCode or PyCharm.
One advantage of using as IDE is that you can preview your changes by:

### Installing mkdocs

Now install mkdocs and dependencies: `pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin`.

### Serving Documetation

If you want to test the documentation, locally run `mkdocs serve` from the project root.

## Super Low Tech

Create your documentation in any work processor (or even create a video!) and [open a feature request](https://github.com/vabene1111/recipes/issues)
attaching your document and requesting that someone add the documentation to Tandoor.
