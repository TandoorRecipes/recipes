This application features a very versatile import and export feature in order 
to offer the best experience possible and allow you to freely choose where your data goes.

The Module is build with maximum flexibility and expandability in mind and allows to easily add new
integrations to allow you to both import and export your recipes into whatever format you desire.

Feel like there is an important integration missing ? Just take a look at the [integration issues](https://github.com/vabene1111/recipes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aintegration) or open a new one
if your favorite one is missing.

!!! warning "WIP"
    Please note that this feature is relatively new and many integrations are missing.
    Additionally, many recipe applications provide formats that are not structured in an easily machine-readable way
    and thus require a lot of work to integrate even tough the module is very versatile.
    If you are good at writing parsers feel free to add new integrations for your favorite services.


## Default
The default integration is the build in (and preferred) way to import and export recipes.
It is maintained with new fields added and contains all data to transfer your recipes from one installation to another.

It is also one of the few recipe formats that is actually structured in a way that allows for 
easy machine readability if you want to use the data for any other purpose.
