This is a docker compose example when using [jwilder's nginx reverse proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen) 
in combination with [jrcs's letsencrypt companion](https://hub.docker.com/r/jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion/).

Please refer to the appropriate documentation on how to setup the reverse proxy and networks.

Copy the docker-compose.override.yml.template and uncomment the corresponding part.
